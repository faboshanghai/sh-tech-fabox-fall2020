# Fabo Academy X - Fall semester 2020

Fablab O Shanghai “Fabo Academy X China”, is a digital manufacturing and rapid prototyping course based on MIT’s “How To Make (Almost) Anything” class (MAS.863/4.140/6.943) and Fab Foundation’s “Fab Academy” global. The course is an overview of the tools and practices commonly used in any Fablab, with a focus on design, project development and documentation.
## COURSE CONTENTS
The course focus is on learning the skills to design and prototype a product/service that solve the problem of a group of users. Design Thinking techniques are used alongside fabrication skill. Student will learn the tools and workflows of the Fablab: 3D scanning, electronic design and programming, basics of 2D sketching and 3D Modeling software, training on laser cutting and 3D printing. These skills are important to learn the constraints and best practices to design objects for digital fabrication tools. Get used to move from design to prototype and back for improvements. Understand how the machines work, what they are used for and what are the materials available, how to adapt the design process to the machine or technique used. Also, production and programming techniques for electronics will be introduced.
## DESIGN THINKING
Throughout the class, students will be introduced to Design Thinking techniques. First, they will conduct a research about the field their product will live in, collect data and informations, interpret the research material through visual storytelling and ideate a final project proposal. At this point they will experience how rapid prototyping works, by moving many times back and forth in both the design and fabrication stage.
The prototyping phase make use of project development and documentation tools, to record and publish the processes, experiment results, designs, code and all the material related to the project. In the end, each student presents the final project to the class.

## DESIGN CHALLENGE BRIEF: “LIFE AT THE TIME OF AN EPIDEMIC”.
The COVID-19 epidemic has hit our planet and the lives of all human beings. Never in its recent history, human kind has been so fragile but at the same time so united to fight a common enemy. How did the epidemic affected the lives of the people living in Shanghai Tech’s campus during this special time? What problems emerged in daily life? How can we design and prototype a solution to one of these problems?
## COURSE STRUCTURE
The principal for teaching is hands-on learning: keeping the theory short but dense before continuing on practical applications. Each student is required to bring his own laptop, in good working order, with a mouse and basic software installed.
Course Length: 1 day/week, 7 days in total + 1 day for presentation of the final projects. On Class Hours: 3 classes (50 min) each day.
Off Class Exercise Hours: 3+.
